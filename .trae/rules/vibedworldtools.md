When fixing issues, attempt to build first and only after multiple attempts and fixes of not being able to either build or solve an error then you can stop the conversation and speak with the user.
When building use java 21 or 17 if the default one doesn't work. (Java 21 seems to work)
This project works on 1.21.10, don't try to build on any other version or bring things from newer minecraft versions which won't work here.
Carefuly inspect edits made before you and don't mess anything up or break it. If you sense you messed up a lot of things revert your changes and try again.
Even if you can don't attempt to start minecraft and test it, make sure you first manage to build the jar file and then let me test it.
Remember to update the version of the mod each iteration you make.
Remember to use the websearch when you need to to find resources, guides and info.
