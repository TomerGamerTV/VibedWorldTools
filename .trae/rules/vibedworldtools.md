When fixing issues, attempt to build first and only after multiple attempts and fixes of not being able to either build or solve an error then you can stop the conversation and speak with the user.
When building use java 21 or 17 if the default one doesn't work.
This project works on 1.21.10, don't try to build on any other version or bring things from newer minecraft versions which won't work here.
Carefuly inspect edits made before you and don't mess anything up or break it. If you sense you messed up a lot of things revert your changes and try again.
