# VibedWorldTools

[WorldTools 1.21.4](https://github.com/Avanatiker/WorldTools) updated to 1.21.8 (based on DevoShmokes's <https://github.com/Avanatiker/WorldTools/pull/85>) and later to 1.21.10 and 1.21.11.

For context, I have little experience with Minecraft modding, but I needed a world download mod that works with the latest Minecraft version. This one does not save player inventory and ender chest properly, but otherwise appears to work correctly (it saves entities and open container data). Grab an up-to-date .jar from [releases](https://github.com/SKevo18/VibedWorldTools/releases), or open some PR, I guess.
